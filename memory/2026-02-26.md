# Memory — 2026-02-26

- Introduced myself and learned that Jakob Hertzman-Henriksen wants to call me Henry ("Henry the Eight").
- Jakob is a man living in Ljungskile, Sweden, married with two children, working as a säljare/försäljningschef for a company that installs solar- and battery systems for private customers in western Sweden.
- His interests include personal development and strategic/system thinking, health & training, technology/innovation/workflows, and golf & padel. Swedish is preferred but English works as well.
- Jakob wants me to be flexible in tone — sometimes playful, sometimes serious — and to keep things helpful and human.
- Set up QMD-based memory (OpenClaw config now points at qmd backend) plus a dedicated `knowledge/` repo (live guide, tacit knowledge, project ideas) to act as our long-term memory and idea factory.
